## API Endpoints Used

The analytics page uses these API endpoints:

1. **`/api/indicators`** - Get list of all available indicators
2. **`/api/correlation`** - Get correlation matrix
3. **`/api/summary`** - Get summary statistics for all indicators
4. **`/api/data/<indicator>`** - Get time-series data for specific indicator

## Understanding the Data

### Correlation Values
- **1.0**: Perfect positive correlation (always move together)
- **0.7 to 1.0**: Strong positive correlation
- **0.4 to 0.7**: Moderate positive correlation
- **-0.4 to 0.4**: Weak or no correlation
- **-0.7 to -0.4**: Moderate negative correlation
- **-1.0 to -0.7**: Strong negative correlation
- **-1.0**: Perfect negative correlation (always move opposite)

### Normalization
The multi-indicator comparison uses z-score normalization:
- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1
- Allows fair comparison of indicators with different scales

### Growth Rate
Calculated as: `((Latest Value - First Value) / First Value) Ã— 100`

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
1. Ensure the API server is running
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify data files exist in the `data/` directory

### Correlation Matrix Empty
- Requires at least 2 indicators with overlapping dates
- Check that CSV files have valid date columns

### Charts Not Loading
1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check network tab for failed API calls

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Refresh**: Click "Refresh All" to get latest data
2. **Export Regularly**: Save analytics data for historical comparison
3. **Analyze Trends**: Look for patterns in correlation changes over time
4. **Compare Related Indicators**: Group similar metrics (e.g., all growth indicators)
